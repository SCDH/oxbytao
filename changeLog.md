## 0.3.0 ##

- new action for removing all but one variants, choose which one to keep

## 0.2.0 ##

- new action for highlighting text referenced by anchor-based markup
  - e.g. highlight the portion text that an external double end-doint
    attached apparatus entry points to
  - this greatly simplyfies navigation and orientation in anchor based markup
- switch the display mode of `<lem>` in CSS depending on the method
  of variant encoding
  - In the *Collapsed* CSS style `<lem>` is only displayed for
    *parallel segmentation* and *external* apparatus entries.
